INSTRUCTIONS

USER GUIDE
--------------------------------------------------

Accompanying this Guide is a video, which will describe the process for using this website. When accessing this site, there is ssl encryption provided, however there is no verification for the certificate by a certificate authority. As such the browser will falsely complain that it is untrustworthy site due to unverified signature. You can continue onto the site, ignoring the complaints from the browser.

CREATE AN ACCOUNT

The first thing you should do is to create a user account on the website. Create an account by clicking CreateUser form. After entering your email, you must check your email account, and click the link it provided for you in the email. Upon clicking the link, it will take you to the login page, where you should login with the password given to you in the email. It is highly recomended that on logging in, that the first thing you do is to change your password to something that is more secure.

SEARCHING

The search feature can search your choice of Users, Posts or Skills. As the site becomes more populated with more content added, the search feature will give better results. However for now, try typing 'James' under Users to see all of the users that match that search. Now try typing 'French' under Skills to see any skill that includes that word. Finally try searching 'post' under Post to see a skill. Any search can be typed in here, and results are returned in date order for Posts and alphabetically for Users and Skills.

MAKE FAVOUR

Has a form for creating a new favour for others to see and respond to. Try creating one, then moving over to 'View Details' on the nav-bar.

VIEW DETAILS

The option defaults to show all of the information about you that has been entered previously. If you select Active Favours on the secondary nav-bar to see all of your 'active' favours. These are favours created, and not yet expired, nor have an exchange of credits made for. They're listed in order of expiry date, you should be able to see the favour you just created in the correct place among the favours. Active Favours also feature the choice to retire, if you want to remove them from circulation before they're expiry. 

If you link to Unredeemed favours, you'll see the favours that you have received credits for but the other party has not 'redeemed' the favour yet. 

By selecting retired favours you can see all of the favours that you have ever created that have either expired, been redeemed or have been manually retired by you. 

Open Favours are all of the favours that you have given credits for, but you have not yet redeemed.

The final option allows you view the entire chronological list (most-recent first) of transaction history between you and other users. All of these options from the secondary-nav-bar will be pretty empty because you've just created a new user, but if you logout, then login with the details:
\begin{itemize}
\item username : guest@email.com
\item password : password
\end{itemize}

I have prepared some sample information for you to see.

All of the lists of data have selectable links that can tell you more information about the favour or the user that is involved. Try them out.

EDIT PROFILE

If you decide that you want to change some of your account details, then make your way to the Edit Profile section. Here there are a lot of different forms, depending on what specifically you want to change. Go ahead and try out some of the edit forms then check View Details to see the changes reflected in your account.

The profile information you can change is email, username, password or currently added skill levels. You can also add a previously created skill or you can create a skill to add.

MESSAGES

When selecting Messages, there are 2 main features. The first, Send Message, allows you to send to a user by using their email address associated with their RHUL\_{}LETS account. Try this by typing in the email currently associated with the account you're logged in with, if it's still the guest account type 'guest@email.com' into the recipient box. Fill in the other fields and hit send. From here go to Conversations, you will now see a notification of (New) and a list of previously started conversations. All conversations are sorted in order of last-recieved message, so you should be able to see the conversation (with yourself no less) sat right at the top of the list. Hit that to see details of the new message, and a transcript of the conversation.

CONTACT,FEEDBACK & LOGOUT

If you experience problems using the site, please use the contact button on the nav-bar to load a mail to the administrator, this will allow your to voice your concern through the medium of email. Alternatively, It is encouraged for all new users to the site to record your experiences, this can be done by hitting Feedback. All responses are anonymous, and help to gather important information about the usability and design of the website, including any application breaking bugs, all of which help to maintain and improve the website.

To return to the home screen and logout, press the 'Logout' button on the nav-bar.
